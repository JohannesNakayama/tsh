# Idea

- note down small ideas
- iterate ideas
- retrieve similar ideas
- group them together
- create larger text units
- eventually, export texts (essays, posts, book chapters, etc.)

- add tags (auto tag?)
- add sources

## Next Steps

- develop a zettel:
    - entrypoint:
        - find by embedding (search bar with result list for selection)
        - most recent (result list for selection)
        - (select date range)
    - select zettel -> open and edit in neovim
    - store new zettel with old zettel id as parent id

- load config from toml file

- search
    - navigate through search results
    - select multiple results and store them as app state

- promote thoughts to texts
    - new struct for texts (with titles, etc.)

- function for remixing only root ideas (otherwise the same idea could end up in a thought twice)

- add tagging
    - automatic tagging with ollama model
    - manual tagging for organization

- store thought on save of vim buffer
    - keep buffer open, then save again on close


## Concepts

Zettel workflows:

- add
- iterate
- remix
- mixin (special case of remix)
