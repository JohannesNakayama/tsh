## Next Steps

- [ ] how are migrations packaged when compiling the program? do I have to put them into the data dir too?

- [ ] add logging/tracing

- [ ] new develop zettel workflow:
    - [ ] entrypoint: most recent (result list for selection)

- [ ] promote zettels to articles
    - [ ] implement functionality in tui

- [ ] function for remixing only root ideas (otherwise the same idea could end up in a thought twice)

- [ ] add tagging
    - [ ] automatic tagging with ollama model
    - [ ] manual tagging for organization

- [ ] store thought on save of vim buffer
    - [ ] keep buffer open, then save again on close

- [ ] fix flickering when entering/exiting neovim
    - [ ] embedded neovim instance with nvim-rs
