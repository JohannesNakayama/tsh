# Using sqlite-vec during Development

Download a pre-compiled binary of `vec0` from the [sqlite-vec releases page](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec/releases) and put it in this directory.
To use sqlite-vec in an interactive sqlite session to inspect the database (e.g., with [`litecli`](https://litecli.com/)), run:

`.load vec0/vec0`
