# Idea

- note down small ideas
- iterate ideas
- retrieve similar ideas
- group them together
- create larger text units
- eventually, export texts (essays, posts, book chapters, etc.)

- add tags (auto tag?)
- add sources

## Next Step

- create embedding for each thought on save
- store embedding in database
- retrieval function for all thoughts related to a natural language query
    - input: natural language query
    - output: thoughts delimited by "\n\n" in a vim buffer
    - side effect: store parent-child relation between input thoughts and output thought
